# Question 3: Another One â€” 5 points

# You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items. Each array items has the following properties:

# items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
# The value of each item in items is unique.

# Return a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.

# Note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.


def mergeSimilarItems(items1, items2):
    # Write your code here




print(mergeSimilarItems([[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]],[[3,1],[1,5]])
      
# expected output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
