# Question 5: String Showdown â€” 5 points

# You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

# Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

# An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.


def minSteps(s,t):




print(minSteps("bab","aba"))
# expected output: 1
