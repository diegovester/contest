# Question 3: Rotate Mix Tape — 5 points

# Given two strings s and goal, 

# return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

# A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

# For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.


def rotate(s,ans):
    # write code here




print(rotate("abcde","cdeab"))
# output answer: True
